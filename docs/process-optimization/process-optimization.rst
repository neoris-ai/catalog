Process optimization is a general term used that refers to quantitative methods used to improve a specific operation or
process.  The output of these methods is delivered by dashboards or reporting generally with the goal of supporting
decision makers.  Process optimization uses techniques from data science, the overlapping field of
`operations research <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research>`_ and requires intimate domain knowledge.
Simulation, `linear programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming>`_,
`integer programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming>`_ and machine learning are common techniques
being applied today.
