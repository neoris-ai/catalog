.. admonition:: Business Opportunity

   Use computer vision to collect vehicle, and personal movement data then combine it with other relevant data in user
   experience that aims to improve health and safety processes at a plant

Computer vision can be used to help ensure only authorized individuals or vehicles access restricted areas.  It can
also be used to help enforce policies around hard-hat usage and other protective gear.

This project is part of a larger initiative call **Active Foresight**.
