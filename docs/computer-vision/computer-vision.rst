`Computer vision <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision>`_ is a field in computer science and artificial
intelligence that teaches computers to derive information from images, videos and other inputs related to the visual
world. The types of inputs could be simple like identifying or quantifying objects in a photograph, but they can also
be more complex like integrating multiple data sources with multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner to help
with disease diagnosis.  `autonomous vehicles <ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation>`_ and
`robotic navigation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_navigation>`_ make extensive use of techniques from computer
vision.

Principal applicaiton areas:

- `Image classification <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_image_classification>`_
- `Object detection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection>`_
- `Object tracking <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_tracking>`_
- `Image segmentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation>`_
