.. admonition:: Business Opportunity

    Use computer vision to collect vehicle movement data then combine it with other relevant data in user experience
    that aims to improve operational efficiencies at a plant

Cement and ready-mix manufacturing plants utilize vehicles for raw materials delivery and for product dispersal.  Each
plant is unique with respect to entries, exits, loading silos and more, but the data on vehicle movement can be collected
in a consistent way.  These data are valuable for decision makers and can help to minimize wait time, schedule downtimes,
optimize staffing and they can be used to improve safety and compliance.

Project Goals
----------------

For the solution to scale to new types of plants and to new countries several project goals needed to be met:

1. Integrate with country and plant level IT ecosystem
2. Flexible approach to model deployment (on-prem, cloud-service, edge-device)
3. Rich user experience to support decision making process
4. Better vehicle recognition metrics than previously used market solution
5. Recognize vehicles and track them using multiple criteria: truck type, identifying numbers, RFID, and licence plates
